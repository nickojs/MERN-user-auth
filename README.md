# What is this
I need to practise this auth flow stuff, so I made this repo. Also, it will be useful in the future for reference, because we are creating and authenticating users all the time.

# About the patterns..
I'm still confused about which pattern to follow on backend development. I know how to apply OO in vanilla JS - with its sugar syntax - not TypeScript (yet). So this will be a MVC-ish project, I guess. 

# Why you are saying all this stuff
Because maybe you are a head hunter looking for a good backend developer , maybe you already know me, so it's a good idea explain stuff.
